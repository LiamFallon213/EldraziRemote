Classification: Abomination

Average Dimensions: 
	Height: 5-20'
	Weight: 100-3000 lbs.

Information: 
 Abominations are the first tier of Eldrazi proper. Abominations often serve as work horses when the [[Scion|scions]] and [[Drone|drones]] are not sufficient. Abominations are often the first Eldrazi seen on a world as they are large enough to be noticed even in small numbers.

  Abominations are the first tier where their reality warping effect tends to distort the world around them as a passive, in contrast to the drone's active distortion abilities. A single Abomination is an extreme threat to a village, or a dangerous enemy for a fortified settlement like a city.
