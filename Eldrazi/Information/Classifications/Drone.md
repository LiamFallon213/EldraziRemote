Drones are the second tier of Eldrazi, some research shows that they may be spawn that consume their brethern, or may be lesser Eldrazi.

Drones are found in two contexts which must be seperated. 

1. In the midst of an Eldrazi Colony
2. Alone in the wild.

When in the first context, drones are only outnumbered by [[Scion||Scions]]
