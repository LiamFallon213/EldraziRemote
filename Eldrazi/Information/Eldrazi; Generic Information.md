# Purpose
The Eldrazi serve as a vast universal balancer. They are attracted to planes that have too much mana in a concentrated place. This is very important to prevent planes from being overrun by any of the planar threats that threated omniplanar domination.  E.g

- [[Slivers]]
- [[Phyrexian Oil]]
- [[Mana Blight]]
- [[Time Rifts]]

These threats are unique in their ability to destabilize more than the plane they inhabit. Slivers, Phyrexians, and Mana Blight act as planar pathogens, consuming planes then moving to the next one. Among these Slivers are the only one that *can* exist on a plane in a stable state. 

When any of these become too extreme, they form extremely large concentrations of unnatural mana. This lures in the Eldrazi who recycle the plane.

Recycling comes in 3 distinct stages

 Annihilation
	This is the most seen step, it involves the Eldrazi destroying the current mana distribution of the plane. This leads to the extinction of all life on the plane. This is a three-pronged movement, Ulamog the Great Consumer eats floating mana. He seeks out the most rich mana pockets and destroys them, allowing the mana to flow into the natural ley lines of the plane, like breaking a dam.  Once this process is finished, the emergence of Kozilek spells doom for the residents. With a critical amount of mana free flowing through the world, Kozilek shatters the leylines at a key point. This causes a runaway effect, the mana from one broken leyline overloads the next, and so on. This eventually leads to a colossal burst of mana vaporizing the matter of the plane.

Construction
	After the burst, Kozilek gets to work forming the mana into land. The tungstun crystals he produces are extremely rich in mana normally. Crystals produced in this stage are some of the most powerful sources of magical energy in plane. Kozilek builds new terrain, weaves new ley lines, mana fountains, etc.

Seeding
	Finally Emrakul begins her job, she travels across the mana rich wasteland and bestowes life. The mana is pulled out and placed into creatures. After this the
