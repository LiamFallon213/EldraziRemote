A world seed is the first crystallization of mana that Kozilek preforms. It acts as a growing point for all the mana to grow off of, it can sometimes contain as much mana in it alone as the rest of the plane combined after seeding. A world seed is the most powerful energy source in existence. As this seed is formed out of pure mana, it can sometimes account for a significant amount of total planar mana. On Zendikar the world seed contains 30% of the total planar mana. On Theros it contains 10% of the total planar mana, but on less arcanely powerful worlds, for example Ravnica or Innistrad, the world seed can account for upwards of 90% of the planar mana. To be clear, that's the total mana throughout the lifetime of the plane, including seeding, which is often a process containing more mana than the rest of the planes' lifespan combined.


Artifacts made with a process involving a world seed include.

- Neverinnals Disk
- the Planar Bridge
-  Glistening Oil
- The Chain Veil
- The Mirai 
- That Which Was Taken

But even those pale in comparison to the artifacts that contain a world seed: the Apocalypse Chime, the Golgothian Sylex, The Immortal Sun. Artifacts capable of destroying entire worlds, or manipulating the multiverse  as a whole.

Only one world seed is currently exposed, the world seed of Zendikar residing in [[The Eye of Ugin]], which served as the power source for the Hedron matrix.

A mage who holds a World Seed has access to effectively infinite power. A mage with sufficient skill, holding a world seed, could brush off even pre mending planes walkers as if they were insects.

An example of the power of a world seed is the Roil on Zendikar.  When the Eldrazi first came to Zendikar, the world seed was damaged and began to bleed out it's power. This resulted in far more free mana then normal, which expressed its self in the Roil, which is litterly the ley lines of Zendikar overflowing like a river after too much rain. All of this mana expenditure is still significantly less than one percent of the mana in Zendikars world seed.

The amount of mana contained within a single world seed can geunily not be overstated. 

Whereas a premending planes walker could create a plane, these were often unstable, or small. If a mage held a world seed, they could easily create a new full plane. 

However, removing the world seed of a plane can have consequences, it will break the cycle of planar rebirth. When the Eldrazi next come, they will instead fully consume the plane, leaving nothing behind. 

This is what happened to [[Caeralia]] (the plane pictured in "All is Dust"). In fact, currently the world seed once belonging to Caeralia resides in the center of [[The Immortal Sun]]. 

The world seed is always at the meeting point of all ley lines. This is not due to an inherint connection, but due to the nature of formation. A world seed is the first point of existance, which is also the point where all ley lines originate from.

Ley lines can absorb extra mana from the seed and vice versa, as seen on [[Zendikar]] but a world seed is not needed for a plane to exist.
