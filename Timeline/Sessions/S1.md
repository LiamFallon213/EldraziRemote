The party is invited to [[The Moonlit Ball]], the festivities are very nice. Then from outside comes screaming, they run out to see what looks to be a small crack in the moon.  *At this point have any who look up roll perception, and if they get a "high" roll have them see a glint of purple, and make a hefty wisdom save*. 

They watch pieces of the moon fall as shooting stars, 

Day and night flicker, in mere seconds the sun rises and sets over a dozen times, the moon however stays in place. As some party goers run away from the ball they hear screaming, and then out of the bushes come a number of creatures. They look like wolves, but they are horrifically mutated, tentacles coming out of their body, and a lattice of flesh replacing their cheeks.
