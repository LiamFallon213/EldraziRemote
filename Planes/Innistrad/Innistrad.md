>The plane is primarily populated by [Humans](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") but these live in fear of a number of classical creatures of horror and regularly fall prey to [Zombies](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie "Zombie"), [Werewolves](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Werewolves "Werewolves"), [Vampires](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire "Vampire") or [Ghosts](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost "Ghost"). Further, [Demons](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Demon "Demon") are becoming an ever-growing threat. It is the plane where the [Innistrad block](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Innistrad_block "Innistrad block") takes place.

>Life on Innistrad is dominated by the single [moon](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Innistrad_moon "Innistrad moon") in its sky. Though the inhabitants of the plane know little about it, the moon drives the seasons and also hunting patterns of the monsters, harvests of the Humans, etc.
>
>Human society is dominated by religion with the [Church of Avacyn](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Avacyn "Church of Avacyn") promising protection from the evils that lurk in the night. The church is named for an [Archangel](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Archangel "Archangel") who helped to drive back the monsters that preyed on Humans. When she went missing, the power vacuum created was rapidly being filled by Demons. A secret cult of Demon worshipers named [Skirsdag](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Skirsdag "Skirsdag") also emerged from this. When [Avacyn](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Avacyn "Avacyn") was released from her prison, the [Helvault](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Helvault "Helvault"), she rallied her troops to contain the Demonic threat and, ultimately, to cleanse Innistrad of all these infernal creatures.

>The common currency on the plane are gold sovereigns (gold coins stamped with Avacyn's collar surrounded by laurels), silvers, and coppers.[2](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Innistrad_(plane)#cite_note-Cursed-2)[3](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Innistrad_(plane)#cite_note-Survivors-3) Two to three gold sovereigns can feed a family for several weeks.
>
>It is also the birthplane of the famous Vampire planeswalker [Sorin Markov](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Sorin_Markov "Sorin Markov"). Innistrad was also home to other native planeswalkers, like the half-devil [Tibalt](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Tibalt "Tibalt"), the deceased [Vronos](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Vronos "Vronos"), and the Werewolf [Arlinn Kord](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Arlinn_Kord "Arlinn Kord").
