# Purpose
The Eldrazi serve as a vast universal balancer. They are attracted to planes that have too much mana in a concentrated place. This is very important to prevent planes from being overrun by any of the planar threats that threated omniplanar domination.  E.g
- [[Slivers]]
- [[Phyrexians]]
- [[Mana Blight]]
