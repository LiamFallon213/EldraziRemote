# Purpose
The Eldrazi serve as a vast universal balancer. They are attracted to planes that have too much mana in a concentrated place. This is very important to prevent planes from being overrun by any of the planar threats that threated omniplanar domination.  E.g

- [[Slivers]]
- [[Phyrexian Oil]]
- [[Mana Blight]]
- [[Time Rifts]]

These threats are unique in their ability to destabilize more than the plane they inhabit. Slivers, Phyrexians, and Mana Blight act as planar pathogens, consuming planes then moving to the next one. Among these Slivers are the only one that *can* exist on a plane in a stable state. 

[[Mana Blight]]
