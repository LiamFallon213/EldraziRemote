Anastasia was a part of the high ranking Vaeloria family before the [[Travails]]. Her family ruled over a fairly large area of Gavony, with their castle in Krothval. Due to her parents being gone most of the time, she effectively raised her younger brother Strava. 

  

Anastasia was 16 when the Travials occurred and the castle and a large portion of the city was destroyed by the brood of [[Emrakul]]. Specifically an Eldrazi Unknowable named Mind Breaker.

  

Anastasia has severe PTSD from what she saw after that. After Mind Breaker moved through [[Krothval]] the residents of the city were driven completely mad. Anastasia has made an oath to never take another human life, as she had to kill so many to escape the city. 

  

Three images from that day are burned into her mind the most, Mind Breaker, her father mutilating her mother, and the moment she had to use a blunt ornamental axe to kill her father. The she found her brother Strava, relief washed over her as she thought he was okay, but as time went on he grew tentacles and it became clear he had been corrupted by Emrakul. She would go onto hire [[Albert Elzavar]] to try to cure him.

  

After that she swore an oath to never take the life of another human. She became a grave cleric and now works to undo the damage caused by the Trevails. Leveraging her noble title and now significant abilities of a life cleric, she has made slow progress. This has put her into multiple confrontations with Olivia Volaren, who has used the chaos to gain more power after the Travails.

  

Anastasia is one of the few people who Olivia is genuinely terrified of: Olivia lost a fight against Anastasia around 2 years after the Travails.

  

Anastasia has Olivia paralized and was preparing the ritual for final death for a vampire. Due to sheer luck, at that moment Anastasia was forced to return to the new city she rules over, Threst, to fend off a werewolf attack.

  

Anastasia rushed the ritual and failed to deliver the final death to Olivia, missing her heart with the wooden stake by millimeters.
