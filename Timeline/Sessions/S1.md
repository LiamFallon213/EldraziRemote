The few people who were looking at the moon are either babbling, screaming, or vegetative.

They watch pieces of the moon fall as shooting stars, one lands nearby with a deafening blast.

Day and night flicker, in mere seconds the sun rises and sets over a dozen times, the moon however stays in place.

They look like wolves, but they are horrifically mutated, tentacles coming out of their body, and a lattice of flesh replacing their cheeks.

After those are defeated then the boss encounter occurs.
