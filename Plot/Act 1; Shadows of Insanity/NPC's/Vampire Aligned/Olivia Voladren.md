Olivia was always near the top of the pecking order. 

  

She is a sociopathic narcissist who genuinely fears only three things, True Death, [[Anastasia Vaeloria]], and Emrakul. 

  

Olivia can’t stand not being in absolute control. She sees even the slightest abnormality as catastrophic.

  

Until The [[Trevails]], Olivia has never met anyone she couldn’t charm, overpower, threaten, or blackmail to get her way. But the Eldrazi Titan Emrakul could not be reasoned with, so after Thraben, she hid in a bunker deep under Stensia. Only coming out after the sealing. This feeling of powerlessness would only be replicated once more, in her first and only duel with [[Anastasia Vaeloria]].

  

Olivia sees herself as the deserved queen of Innistrad, and will do whatever she needs to do to get there.
