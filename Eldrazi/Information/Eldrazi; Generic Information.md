# Purpose
The Eldrazi serve as a vast universal balancer. They are attracted to planes that have too much mana in a concentrated place. This is very important to prevent planes from being overrun by any of the planar threats that threated omniplanar domination.  E.g

- [[Slivers]]
- [[Phyrexians]]
- [[Mana Blight]]
- [[Time Rifts]]

These threats are unique in their ability to destabilize more than the plane they inhabit. Slivers, Phyrexians, and Mana Blight act as planar pathogens, consuming planes then moving to the next one. Among these Slivers are the only one that *can* exist on a plane in a stable state. 

Modern Phyrexia acts on a plane, much like a virus acts on a cell. It corrupts it, turns its ability to make new life into an engine of machine and death. The only saving grace is Phyrexian's inability to traverse planes. This fortunate sideeffect however seems to have been sidestepped by [[Jin-Gitaxis]] recently.
