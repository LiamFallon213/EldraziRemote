**The Eldrazi** are a race of alien devourers. Existing for nearly as long as the Multiverse itself, the Eldrazi have traveled throughout the Multiverse, going to planes and consuming their mana. This has resulted in the destruction of numerous planes and an untold number of deaths. Once one of the main titans Eldrazi find a plane with a sufficient amount of mana, they form avatars to enter that plane. Then, they spawn drones and processors to absorb the mana from the inhabitants of said plane and the world itself. Once completed, the Titan leaves and the unlucky plane is left as only a husk. They are necessary to sustain the ecosystem of the Multiverse. The Eldrazi have posed as threat to numerous Planeswalkers, but few were strong enough to face them.
