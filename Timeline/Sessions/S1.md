The party is invited to [[The Moonlit Ball]], the festivities are very nice.  the moon light begins to flicker. Then from outside comes screaming, they run out to see the moon with a large hole in it. They see pieces of moon falling through the atmosphere. The few people who were looking at the moon are either babbling, screaming, or vegetative.

They watch pieces of the moon fall as shooting stars, one lands nearby with a deafening blast.

Day and night flicker, in mere seconds the sun rises and sets over a dozen times, the moon however stays in place. As some party goers run away from the ball they hear screaming, and then out of the bushes come a number of creatures. Anyone with a good History can roll to find these are Eldrazi Scions

After those are defeated then the boss encounter occurs. 


Everyone who is still alive, and hasn't fled looks to [[Olivia Voladren]], but she has already fled. The Ball devolves into chaos as more Eldrazi scions begin to pour in. Then the ground shakes as a larger Eldrazi arrives

This is an Eldrazi drone, it stands 5 feet tall. (CR: 3).

After that is defeated, the party begins to relax when an Eldrazi'd ware wolf (considered an [[Abominations|Abomination]]) attacks.  (absurd encounter, they nee)![[Pasted image 20220722035728.png]]
