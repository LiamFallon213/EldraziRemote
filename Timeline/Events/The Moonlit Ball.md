	The story for our heros begins
</span>

During the last 13 years, many events have happened. With [[Emrakul]] trapped in the moon, the day night cycle has become erratic, night can fall in minutes, and last for months. Or night could last mere minutes.

The Moonlit Ball is a celebration thrown by [[Olivia Voladren]]. To celebrate the 13th anniversary of [[The Trevails]]. The event that brought her to the position of [[Vampire Lord]]. This is also a celebration of her coronation, 10 years ago.
