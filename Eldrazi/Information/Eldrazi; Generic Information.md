# Purpose
The Eldrazi serve as a vast universal balancer. They are attracted to planes that have too much mana in a concentrated place. This is very important to prevent planes from being overrun by any of the planar threats that threated omniplanar domination.  E.g

- [[Slivers]]
- [[Phyrexian Oil]]
- [[Mana Blight]]
- [[Time Rifts]]

These threats are unique in their ability to destabilize more than the plane they inhabit. Slivers, Phyrexians, and Mana Blight act as planar pathogens, consuming planes then moving to the next one. Among these Slivers are the only one that *can* exist on a plane in a stable state. 

When any of these become too extreme, they form extremely large concentrations of unnatural mana. This lures in the Eldrazi who recycle the plane.

Recycling comes in 3 distinct stages

 Annihilation
	This is the most seen step, it involves the Eldrazi destroying the current mana distribution of the plane. This leads to the extinction of all life on the plane. This is a three-pronged movement, Ulamog the Great Consumer eats floating mana. He seeks out the most rich mana pockets and destroys them, allowing the mana to flow into the natural ley lines of the plane, like breaking a dam.  Once this process is finished, the emergence of Kozilek spells doom for the residents. With a critical amount of mana free flowing through the world, Kozilek shatters the leylines at a key point. This causes a runaway effect, the mana from one broken leyline overloads the next, and so on. This eventually leads to a colossal burst of mana vaporizing the matter of the plane. Like a broken dam washing away a city, so does the mana wash away the world.

Construction
	After the burst, Kozilek gets to work forming the floating mana into land. The tungsten crystals he produces are extremely rich in mana normally. Crystals produced in this stage are some of the most powerful sources of magical energy in plane. Kozilek builds new terrain, weaves new ley lines, mana fountains, etc.

Seeding
	Finally Emrakul begins her job, she travels across the mana rich wasteland and bestows life. The mana is pulled out and placed into creatures. After this the recycling is complete and the Eldrazi leave. While the vast majority of the creation crystals are destoryed in this process, occasionally some survive and when found often lead to some of the most powerful items in creation. Glistening Oil, the Apocalypse Chime, the Planar Bridge, the Golgothian Sylex, The Mirai, That Which Was Taken, The Immortal Sun, Neverinnals Disk, The Chain Veil,


This is not a random process, Emrakul created it along with Ulamog and Kozilek. She is also the guider of the process. While all three Titans are vastly more intelligent then the average man, they do vary. Ulamog is highly intelligent, but can be out thought by the most powerful intellects, like Nicol Bolos and Jace.

Kozilek is many orders of magnitude more intelligent, attempting to out think Kozilek has been equated to trying to empty an ocean with a bucket.

Emrakul however, is the most intelligent. She possesses such a powerful intelligence, she is able to play out all situations millennia in advance. She knows nay choice you could make, the chances of you taking any given path, and exactly how to use that. If out thinking Kozilek is like trying to empty an ocean with a bucket, trying to out think Emrakul is like trying to extinguish a forest fire with lantern oil. Emrakul knew every possible life you could have lived, every choice you could have made, the chances of all of them, and how to use them to further her goals, she knew that millenia before your birth.

Emrakul is also the only Titan who has agents on other planes.
