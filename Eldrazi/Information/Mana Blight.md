Mana Blight is a type of exotic life. It's a memetic virus. Where normal life has genetic code, the entire genome of Mana Blight is carried in the memories of those it inhabits. It then will warp their mind to transfer the information into any storage medium available. This warping eventually drives the host into such a state of insanity that they do not provide for their basic needs and die.

Mana Blight inhabits the subconscious of infected individuals, slowly manipulating them into positions where they can disseminate the information optimally.

Mana Blight can be transported by any medium of information exchange, yet can only infect via a visual or auditory ; however it can only infect sentient beings who have a human like mental structure.  Examples include

- Humans
- Elves
- Vampires
- Sentient Dragons
- Artificial Intelligences based on human like minds
- Spirits (Kamigawa)
- Phyrexians (Intelligent)
- Angels, Demons, Devils
- Certain Deities (Theros Espicially)

Examples of creatures immune to the adverse effects of [[Mana Blight]].

- Hive Minds
- Eldrazi
- Species without a spoken or written language
- Species with irregular perception of space time
- Artificial Intelligences based on immune life forms or acting as a hive
