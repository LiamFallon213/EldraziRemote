Then from outside comes screaming, they run out to see the moon with a large hole in it. They see pieces of moon falling through the atmosphere. The few people who were looking at the moon are either babbling, screaming, or vegetative.

They watch pieces of the moon fall as shooting stars, one lands nearby with a deafening blast.

Day and night flicker, in mere seconds the sun rises and sets over a dozen times, the moon however stays in place. As some party goers run away from the ball they hear screaming, and then out of the bushes come a number of creatures. Anyone with a good History can roll to find these are Eldrazi Scions
