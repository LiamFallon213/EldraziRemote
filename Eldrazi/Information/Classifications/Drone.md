Information: 
	Drones are the second tier of Eldrazi, some research shows that they may be spawn that consume their brethren, or may be lesser Eldrazi.

   Drones are found in two contexts, which must be separated. 

  1. In the midst of an Eldrazi Colony
  2. Alone in the wild.

  When in the first context, drones are only outnumbered by [[Scion|Scions]] in their number. 

  Drones are often the commanders of the [[Scion|Scions]] they direct the actions of them. Drones are also the progenitors of most of the scions.

  Some drones specialize into spawn creators known as Brood mothers, which are the progenitors of many of the [[Scion|Scions]].

  Small drones are the limit of what most defences can realistically hold off.
