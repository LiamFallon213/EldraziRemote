The Eldrazi serve as a vast universal balancer. They are attracted to planes that have too much mana in a concentrated place. This is very important to prevent planes from being overrun by any of the planar threats that threated omniplanar domination.  E.g

- [[Slivers]]
- [[Phyrexian Oil]]
- [[Mana Blight]]
- [[Time Rifts]]

These threats are unique in their ability to destabilize more than the plane they inhabit. Slivers, Phyrexians, and Mana Blight act as planar pathogens, consuming planes then moving to the next one. Among these Slivers are the only one that *can* exist on a plane in a stable state. 

When any of these become too extreme, they form extremely large concentrations of unnatural mana. This lures in the Eldrazi who recycle the plane.

Recycling comes in 3 distinct stages

 Annihilation
	This is the most seen step, it involves the Eldrazi destroying the current mana distribution of the plane. This leads to the extinction of all life on the plane. This is a three-pronged movement, Ulamog the Great Consumer eats floating mana. He seeks out the most rich mana pockets and destroys them, allowing the mana to flow into the natural ley lines of the plane, like breaking a dam. While this is happening, Kozilek shatters the ley lines on the world. they overflow into the rocks nearby, giving the distinct tungsten look to his path. While this heppens Emrakul
